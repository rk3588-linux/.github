# RK3588 Linux

An implementation of all the necessary components to build, boot, and
install Linux on the RK3588 SoC. This includes writing the device
tree, device drivers, and Kernel configuration. This is meant to be a
learning experience on the ARM64 architecture, writing device drivers,
and what it takes to port arm64 based platforms to Linux.
